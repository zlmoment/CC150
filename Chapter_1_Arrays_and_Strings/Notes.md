## Chapter 1:  Arrays and Strings

Array questions and string questions are often interchangeable.

### Hash Tables

That maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup.

### ArrayList

Dynamically resizing array.

### StringBuffer

It simply creates an **array** of all the strings, copying them back to a string only when necessary.
